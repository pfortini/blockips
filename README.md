![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)
![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-Linux-green.svg)

A powerful, cumulative IP blocking tool for Linux systems that provides **dual-layer protection** using both iptables (system-level) and Apache .htaccess (web server-level) blocking.

## Features

### **Core Functionality**
- **Cumulative IP Blocking** - Add new IPs without removing existing blocks
- **Dual-Layer Protection** - System-level (iptables) + Web server-level (Apache) blocking
- **Persistent Storage** - Blocked IPs survive system reboots
- **Duplicate Prevention** - Won't block the same IP twice
- **Input Validation** - Validates IP address format before processing

### **Management Features**
- **List Blocked IPs** - View all currently blocked addresses
- **Unblock Individual IPs** - Remove specific IP addresses from block list
- **Clear All Blocks** - Remove all blocked IPs with confirmation prompt
- **Colored Output** - Easy-to-read status messages with color coding
- **Detailed Summaries** - See exactly what happened after each operation

### **Security Features**
- **Root Privilege Check** - Ensures proper permissions for system modifications
- **Custom iptables Chain** - Uses dedicated chain for organized rule management
- **Automatic Environment Setup** - Creates necessary directories and files
- **Safe Unblocking** - Removes rules from all blocking layers

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockips.git
cd blockips

# Make the script executable and install it
sudo cp blockips /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/blockips
```

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Block a single IP address
sudo blockips 192.168.1.100

# Block multiple IP addresses at once
sudo blockips 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.5 172.16.0.10

# List all currently blocked IPs
sudo blockips --list

# Unblock a specific IP address
sudo blockips --unblock 192.168.1.100

# Clear all blocked IPs (with confirmation)
sudo blockips --clear

# Show help and usage information
blockips --help

# Test with invalid IP (will be rejected)
sudo blockips 999.999.999.999 192.168.1.50

# Example output:
# ‚úó Invalid IP address format: 999.999.999.999
# ‚úì Blocked 192.168.1.50 in iptables
# 
# === SUMMARY ===
# New IPs blocked: 1
# Duplicate IPs (already blocked): 0
# Invalid IPs: 1
```
